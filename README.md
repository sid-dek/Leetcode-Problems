# Leetcode-Problems

We Computer Science aspirants know that LeetCode is a necessity to enhance our programming skills. So here are my efforts to update this repo so as to share my solutions to all other developers who might benefit from these. Feel free to help yourself with anything in this repo.

## Getting Started

I have Python and Java folders where I'll be constantly updating my solutions in the respective folders. The files are named as QuestionNumber_QuestionDescription.

### Prerequisites

All you need is a Java environment / Python installed in your system (if using it locally) otherwise nothing at all ! (If you're using LeetCode)
